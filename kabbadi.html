        <b>Kabaddi</b> is a traditional Indian contact team sport played by two
        teams of seven players each, where a raider enters the opponent's court
        to tag defenders and return safely to their own side while continuously
        chanting "kabaddi" in a single breath. Originating in ancient India,
        this sport relies on strength, strategy, and agility, with points scored
        for successful tags and for successfully tackling the raider. The game,
        which features a rectangular field divided into two halves, is a
        significant part of India's physical education curriculum and has gained
        significant international recognition, particularly after its inclusion
        in the Asian Games and the launch of the popular Pro Kabaddi League.
