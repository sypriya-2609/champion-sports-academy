        Hockey is a family of team sports where two opposing teams use hockey
        sticks to hit a ball or puck into the opponent's goal to score points.
        Popular variations include field hockey, played on a grass or turf field
        with 11 players and a ball, and ice hockey, played on a sheet of ice
        with skates and a puck.

      <dd>
        use only the flat side of the stick to play the ball, do not use your
        body (except the goalkeeper) to control the ball, goals must be scored
        from within the designated shooting circle, no contact or obstruction is
        allowed between players, and it's a foul to hit the ball dangerously or
        with the rounded side of the stick.
